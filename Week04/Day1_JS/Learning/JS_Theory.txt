Javascript is a high level (often) just-in-time compiled programming language that conforms to ECMAScript specification.
    High-level: Friendly language to write code with.
    Just-in-time compiled: It is compiled during execution rather than before execution.
    ECMAScript: It is a standard that Js adheres to, which ensures the code we write works across any browser.
Js, alongside HTML and CSS, is one of the core technologies of world wide web.
Js is used to handle interactivity and updates in the web applications. It is because each browser have a dedicated engine to execute Js code (in-broswer).
Js can be used to build server side applications.
Js is also used in mobile app development to create cross platform apps that can run on both iOS and android.
