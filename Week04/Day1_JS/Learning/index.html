<!-- Javascript is a high level (often) just-in-time compiled programming language that conforms to ECMAScript specification.
    High-level: Friendly language to write code with.
    Just-in-time compiled: It is compiled during execution rather than before execution.
    ECMAScript: It is a standard that Js adheres to, which ensures the code we write works across any browser.
Js, alongside HTML and CSS, is one of the core technologies of world wide web.
Js is used to handle interactivity and updates in the web applications. It is because each browser have a dedicated engine to execute Js code (in-broswer).
Js can be used to build server side applications.
Js is also used in mobile app development to create cross platform apps that can run on both iOS and android.
Js is also used to create desktop applications.

    <h1>Js Crash Course</h1>
<!-- You can run the Js code in the browser or in the node.
In-Browser:
    The simplest way is to run it on the browser console. Only suited for short snippets -->
    <!-- Output:
    console.log("Hello World"); -->
    <script>
        // Second way of running Js in browser
        console.log("Hello from the script");
    </script>
    <!-- Third way of running Js code in browser is to use external js file. -->
    <!-- We can connect js external file with html file using following: -->
    <script src="main.js"></script>
<!-- Server-side (node): -->
    <!-- In order to run a js file on node use : node main.js OR node main
    In order to check if node exists in your system and what is the version, use : node -v -->
